# MessageMe
---
MessageMe is an instant messaging platform utilizing ActionCable, WebSocket protocol and Semantic-UI.

# Motivation
---
Social media is an industry I am fascinated with because of it's ability to empower users to be their own brand and make connections worldwide. I wanted to understand the functionality behind the various components that are implemented in these platforms by building them out in this app. With this app in particular I wanted to explore utilizing clean OOP principles to create an application that shows mastery of Ruby on Rails while exploring ActionCable and WebSocket protocol. 

# Heroku 
---
[Heroku](https://talky-talk-12.herokuapp.com/)

# Tehcnologies Used
---
# - Ruby on Rails
  Ruby is a flexible OOP language that allowed me to execute a proof of concept fairly quickly. Rails is a development framework which makes abstracting out tasks much easier and allows me to DRY up my code. 

# - Postgresql
  Postgresql is a program that allows me to easily create a relational database and view my data in clear and distinct tables. Assist with deploying to Heroku.

# - Semantic-UI
  Ability to dispatch easy to customize, ready to use, and professional styling components. Helped speed up production of my application.

# - Bcrypt
  Along with customized authentication and authorization, Bcrypt adds an extra layer of security by hashing passwords.

# - ActionCable and WebSockets
  Ability to seamlessly integrate WebSockets within a rails application to allow real-time messaging features while still being scalable.
